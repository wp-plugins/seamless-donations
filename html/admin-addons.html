            <h3>Improve Outgoing Email Reliability</h3>
            Because every WordPress hosting environment is different, the built-in WordPress email capability often is somewhat unreliable. The following plugins use external mailing engines and substantially improve mailing reliability. Here’s <A href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-fix-wordpress-not-sending-email-issue/">a good explainer article from WPBeginner</A>.
            <h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/">Postman SMTP Mailer</a></h3>
            Take control of your outgoing email with this modern, friendly and reliable SMTP Mailer for WordPress. Plus, Seamless Donations users have gotten to know the plugin’s author courtesy of his excellent support.
            <h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/sendgrid-email-delivery-simplified/">SendGrid</a></h3>
            Send emails through SendGrid from your WordPress installation using SMTP or API integration. The SendGrid plugin is used for email delivery on this site.
            <h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpmandrill/">wpMandrill by the MailChimp folks</a></h3>
            The wpMandrill plugin sends emails that are generated by WordPress through Mandrill, a transactional email service powered by MailChimp.
            <h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/">WP Mail SMTP</a></h3>
            Reconfigures the wp_mail() function to use SMTP instead of mail() and creates an options page to manage the settings. 400,00 downloads and 4.7 stars, so it’s definitely a relied-upon solution.
